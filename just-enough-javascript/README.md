# Just Enough JavaScript

JavaScript is a huge and powerful programming language, this makes it exciting but also challenging to learn.

In this module you will only learn a small part of what JavaScript has to offer. You will learn _just enough_ JavaScript to make small programs that process text and interact with users. Why just enough, and not a little more? Because reading and understanding program logic is more important than JavaScript, so why let the code get in the way?

In this directory is is all the JavaScript you will find in this module's examples and exercises. Don't be mistaken, there's a lot you can do with only this!

Your goal in this module is to analyze and understand code written with these language features. Examples in this chapter are each given a priority (ü•ö, üê£, üê•). You know you have mastered an example when you are comfortable explaining what it does and how it works to a classmate.
