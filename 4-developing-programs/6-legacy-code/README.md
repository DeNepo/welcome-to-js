# Legacy Code

**Legacy Code** is software that was written in the past that is still used
today. Often legacy code was written by someone who no longer works for a
company, or was even written in a language that current developers don't know
very well - or at all!

A classic example of legacy code is
[COBOL](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/04/20/brush-up-your-cobol-why-is-a-60-year-old-language-suddenly-in-demand/)
in
[Banking](https://www.fintechfutures.com/2021/11/legacy-systems-in-banking-the-major-barrier-for-digital-transformation/),
but not all legacy code is so extreme. Legacy code might also be written 6
months ago but still be hard to understand because it was poorly documented,
poorly written, or is simply 1000 lines of code that you have 1 day to study
before shipping a new feature.

## Your Challenge

In these exercises you will be given programs that work, but are poorly or
confusingly written. Some of the programs may contain JS language features you
haven't learned yet, that's part of the challenge! You don't need to master
those features or use them in your refactor, but will need to study them enough
to understand what they are doing in the legacy code. You might even find that
you can refactor the program without understanding all of it! So don't loose
toooo much time on each detail, focus on the big picture and refactor the
program so _you_ understand it.

Your task is to rewrite the programs in `/exercises` so they ...

1. ... are easier for a developer to understand.
2. ... are more intuitive for the user.
3. ... implement simpler computer instructions.

You don't need to worry about efficiency, optimizing programs for speed is more
advanced skill you can learn later in your development life when you start
building programs that are noticeably slow.

> PS. You have already studied programs with similar behavior to these
> exercises. Challenge yourself to complete these exercises without looking back
> to past programs. Try to find new ways of writing these programs that fit your
> style.
