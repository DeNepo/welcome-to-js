# Pair Programming

[Pair programming](https://gist.github.com/healeycodes/5acc53131957f6a96a281c89890c7706)
is a simple idea that takes some practice to get used to. In pair programming
you have two people at one computer working on a single project. Each person
takes turns in these two roles:

- **Navigator**: You are the one deciding how to approach the problem and what
  code to write, but you will not be the one typing it! You will explain your
  ideas to the Driver who will actually write the code. The Driver can ask
  questions and challenge your ideas, but ultimately you get to decide what is
  written.
- **Driver**: You are the one actually typing, moving the mouse, and using the
  computer, but you ultimately write what the Navigator is thinking. As a Driver
  you will ask questions and challenge the Navigator's ideas, but the Navigator
  has the final say on what code is written.

## Practice

To practice pair programming there are 4 small programs you can develop in
pairs. You have already studied these programs in Just Enough JavaScript, so you
should be able to focus on your pair programming role instead of how to solve
the problem.

In pair programming it's good to switch roles regularly. Try switching roles for
each user story in the spec. This strategy will accomplish two things:

1. You will both have a chance to practice each role.
2. You will experience _incremental development_ - writing a program one step at
   a time, where each step adds user-facing behavior.

Happy coding!
