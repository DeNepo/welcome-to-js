/*
  a user can provide input that contains only uppercase and lowercase letters
    - given the user cancels, they will be prompted again
    - given the input is empty, they will be prompted again
    - given their input contains anything that is not a letter, they will be prompted again
    - given their input is valid, the loop will exit and their input is alerted

  test cases:
    invalid input:
      (no test cases! the loop will not exit so there will be no output to test)
    input with only letters:
      'abcdABCD' -> 'abcdABCD'
      'JAVAscript' -> 'JAVAscript'
      'hi' -> 'hi'
