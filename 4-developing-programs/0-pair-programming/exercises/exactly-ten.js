/*
  a user can provide input that is 10 characters long
    - given they cancel, a message is displayed and they are prompted again
    - given the input is too short, they are told how much too short and prompted again
    - given the input is too long, they are told how much too long and prompted again
    - given the input is 10 characters, the loop will exit and the input is alerted

  test cases:
    invalid input:
      (no test cases! the loop will not exit so there will be no output to test)
    input of 10 characters
      'javascript' -> 'javascript'
      '0123456789' -> '0123456789'
      'a b c d e ' -> 'a b c d e '
