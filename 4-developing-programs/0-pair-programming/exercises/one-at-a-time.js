/*
  a user can add single characters to a string until they confirm they have finished
    - given they cancel, they see a helpful message and are prompted again
    - given the input is empty, they see a helpful message and are prompted again
    - given the input is longer than 1 character, they see a helpful message and are prompted again
    - given the input is a single character, the input is appended to the output
    - given the user confirms the output is complete, the loop will end and the output is displayed

  no test cases!
    this program cannot be tested by input/output pairs
