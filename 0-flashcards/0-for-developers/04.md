## `'use strict';` (_Strict Mode_)

```js
/*
  this will work, the program is not in strict mode

  using variables without declaring them is OK
*/

greeting = 'hello! (not in strict mode, undeclared variable)';

console.log(greeting); // 'hello! ...'
```

```js
'use strict';

/*
  this will throw an error, the program IS in strict mode

  using variables without declaring them is NOT OK
*/

// an error will occur on this line
greeting = 'hello! (strict mode, undeclared variable)';

// the log will never happen!
console.log(greeting);
```

```js
'use strict';

/*
  this will work in strict mode

  the variable is declared before it is used
*/

let greeting = 'hello! (strict mode, declared variable)';

console.log(greeting); // 'hello! ...'
```

> PS. Sometimes it's called
> [sloppy mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Sloppy_mode)
> when you write code without `'use strict';`.
