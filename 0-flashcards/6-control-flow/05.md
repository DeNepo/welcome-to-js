# Control Flow

This type of **control flow** is used when you want to execute a block of code
_as long as_ a condition is truthy. The condition is checked once before each
iteration.

## A While Loop

```js
'use strict';

let userInput = null;

while (userInput === null) {
  // execute the body until the user clicks "ok"
  userInput = prompt('do not cancel');
}

alert('all done: ' + userInput);
```
