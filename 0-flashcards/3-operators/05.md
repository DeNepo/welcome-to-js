# Operators

This operator does double duty, and it has two names!

- when used with strings, it combines two strings into one string
- when used with numbers, it adds them like in normal math

What is it called in each of these situations?

## `+`

### With Strings: _concatenation_

```js
'use strict';

// you can use this operator directly with primitives directly
console.log('4' + '5');

// or indirectly with values stored in variables
let stringFour = '4';
let stringFive = '5';
console.log(stringFour + stringFive);
```

### With Numbers: _addition_

```js
'use strict';

// you can use this operator directly with primitives directly
console.log(4 + 5);

// or indirectly with values stored in variables
let numberFour = 4;
let numberFive = 5;
console.log(numberFour + numberFive);
```
