# Code Reading Sessions

This folder contains a set of exercises which can be used in Code Reading Clubs.
Of course, your club does not need to use all exercises, they are meant as a
starting point. If you are trying out variants, do let us know! For now we have
divided them into basic and advanced. Advanced exercises can be used in clubs
that have been running for a while, and especially work well when doing a second
code club using the same code snippet.
