Practice reading and describing programs

Describing Programs

  **[../describing-programs](../describing-programs)** and discuss how you can
  make sense of code you don't understand yet
- **In Small Groups**: practice describing programs

### After Break

- How do you describe a program? Why?
- Practice writing comments to describe small programs

No project. Just lots of study time, alone and in groups. Keep asking questions!
