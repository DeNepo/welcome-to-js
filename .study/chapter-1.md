# Chapter 1: Programming

Begin learning JS syntax and vocabulary, reading code out loud, and tracing
variables.

## Before Class

> Do you have any questions from last week? Add the `question` label to an issue
> in your class repo so your coaches know what to review!

- Look through [Suggested Study](./suggested-study.md)
  - _What is Programming?_
  - _What is JavaScript?_
- Watch [../printing-code.mp4](../printing-code.mp4)
- Play [compute-it](http://compute-it.toxicode.fr/) through level 15
- Skim these chapters from
  [../just-enough-javascript](../just-enough-javascript)
  - Comments and Logs
  - `guide-tracing.mp4`
  - Variables
  - Conditionals

## During Class

Learn different ways you can trace a program's execution.

## Before Break

- Q/A about "What is JavaScript?"
- How to open and study the module
- Begin studying [../programming](../programming) in small groups

## After Break

- Continue studying [../programming](../programming) in small groups

## After Class

No project. Just lots of study time, alone and in groups. Take some time to look
through all of the folders
[Welcome to JS](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/welcome-to-js), here's
some ideas for what to focus on this week:

Take a look through **[../printables](../printables)** and print the ones you
think will be most helpful. Then move on to the practice:

- 🥚 [compute-it](http://compute-it.toxicode.fr/), 🐣
  [little-dot](http://little-dot.toxicode.fr/)
- 🥚 **[../flashcards](../flashcards)**: ~20 minutes every day
- 🥚 Finish studying **[../programming](../programming)**
