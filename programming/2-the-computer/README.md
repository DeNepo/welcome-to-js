# The Computer

You've been the user of many websites, you've even developed a few with HTML &
CSS, but you haven't had to _be the computer_ yet. With HTML & CSS it's enough
to learn what goes in and what comes out, you don't need to know what happens in
between:

- HTML/CSS goes into a browser -> ... ? ... -> a website is displayed

With JavaScript it's the complete opposite. What the program _does_ (inputs ->
outputs) is less important than _how it happens_. Your goal now isn't to amaze
the user, it's to become the computer and understand what happens between the
input and the output:

- source code -> **a lot of important steps** -> final output

## Computer Empathy

A program is just a series of instructions. If you follow the instructions
_exactly_ like the computer would, you are actually running the program by hand!
(just a lot slower.) There is no difference in theory between you following the
code's instructions and a computer following the same instructions.

So when you practice tracing think of it as building your _computer empathy_:
understanding what it's like to be the computer as it runs your program. If the
first rule in design is "know your user", then one of the first rule in coding
should be "know your computer". After all, the computer is one of your code's
users!
