# Some History

JavaScript has an interesting history, it was originally created in 1 week
during 1995 by Brendan Eich and since then has gone through many many changes.

At first it was just a small language used for small interactions in web pages.
Over the years as the internet has grown and browsers have become more powerful,
JavaScript has evolved from a small language for small interactions to a huge
programming language capable of building complex applications.

As JavaScript grew, so did the number of developers who use it. All these
developers pushed the limits of JavaScript, created new tooling, different
conventions, and generally made the JS ecosystem a fascinating (and
frustrating!) place to work. This human history of JavaScript is what makes it
so interesting.

## Backwards Compatibility

> or "don’t break the internet!”

An important concept for understanding the JavaScript language is "**Backwards
Compatibility**". Backwards Compatibility means that any program ever written in
JavaScript must _always_ work!

Any time something is added to JavaScript or the language is changed in any way,
older programs must still be valid JavaScript. This is important because people
have been websites for decades now. It would be bad if one day every website
written before 2003 no longer worked because of a recent change in JavaScript.

Imagine if every word, sentence, and grammar in your native language's history
needed to be understood by every native speaker for the rest of eternity! You
would need to be just as comfortable reading a story written 4000 years ago as
one written yesterday. This would make it very hard for languages to change and
grow, but this is the case for JavaScript.

## ES6rohitdhatrak

ES6 was a new version of JavaScript released in 2015, it contained major changes
to the language that improved the developer experience. ES6 marked such a large
change in JavaScript that it's fair to talk about the JS world before ES6 and
after ES6 as different eras.

You can learn more about ES6 another time, for now you just need to know it was
such a big improvement that it belongs in every history of JS.

## The Future of JavaScript

All new features for the JavaScript language are presented and discussed in the
[tc39 github organization](https://github.com/tc39). If you're curious looking
through the [proposals repository](https://github.com/tc39/proposals) can be
interesting to see how people plan and discuss additions to the JS language.
