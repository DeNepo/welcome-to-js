# JavaScript

JavaScript is the only programming language supported by web browsers, this
makes is a very common language. Every website that needs interactivity uses
JavaScript alongside HTML & CSS. Because people across the world with all levels
of programming experience are writing web pages, JavaScript has become something
like the English of programming languages:

- It's everywhere, most developers will know at least a little bit of
  JavaScript.
- It's a messy and complicated language, full of exceptions and concepts
  borrowed from other languages.
- It's easy enough to get started with the basics, and without too much
  experience you can already get your ideas across.

So why learn JavaScript? Because it's quick to get started, you can do a lot
with it, and there's lots of work for a good JavaScript developer.

## Running JavaScript

There are many ways you can run JavaScript, for now you should know about these
options:

---

### 1. Writing directly in the console

> This is closest to how you will be studying JS in this module.

Writing JS in your browser's console is the simplest and quickest way to run
some JavaScript, but is limited. It's perfect for doing little experiments to
see how something works, but it's not possible to write and save a full program.

<details>
<summary>Try copy-pasting this code into your browser's console and pressing "enter"</summary>
<br>

```js
/* --- for the computer --- */
'use strict';

/* --- for the developer --- */

// log to the console for developers to read
console.log('hello developer (console)');

/* --- for the user --- */

// alert hello for the user
//  not a great UX, but easy to program
//  you'll use this for now
alert('hello user (alert)');
```

</details>

### 2. Writing directly in an HTML file

You can also write your code in a script tag of an HTML file then open the HTML
file in your browser. The JavaScript will run automatically when the page is
loaded. See this in action with `./1-inline-script-tag.html`.

You will learn about this later in the course for examples and exercises that
introduce how JavaScript interacts with the DOM. It's easier to understand "the
big picture" when you can see everything in one document.

### 3. Loading JS files into HTML

You can also write your code in a separate `.js` file, then load the file into
your HTML to execute the code. There are two different ways you can load a `.js`
file into your HTML, you can see them in action with `./2-separate-script-file` and
`./3-separate-module-files` (you'll learn more about scripts vs. modules later on).

You will use this for larger projects and for collaboration. Separating code
into smaller files each with a clear purpose makes your code base easier to
understand, debug, and to divide into group tasks.

### 4. Specialized Browser Environments

There are also many specialized environments for writing and running JavaScript
in a browser, each one has a specific use case:

- **Study Lenses**: This is an environment specialized for studying JavaScript
  locally with your text editor and a browser. It has features for understanding
  different aspects of code and for visualizing what happens during execution.
  The "run" and "debug" buttons in Study Lenses execute your code directly in
  the browser just like if you loaded a script into an HTML file. This will help
  you learn your browser's DevTools and help you eventually transition away from
  the learning environment and towards professional devtools. (_the material in
  this repo is written for Study Lenses_)
- **Online IDEs**: There are many online IDEs (Integrated Development
  Environments) designed for easy setup, collaboration, and sharing. Online IDEs
  try to match the developer experience of working on your local machine, but
  online. These are easy to use, but they're not beginner toys! You can use
  these to develop full projects with a wide variety of programming languages,
  libraries and frameworks. Some popular ones are [Repl.it](https://repl.it/),
  [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/),
  [Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) or
  [Glitch](https://glitch.com/).
- **Online Learning Environments**: There are also many online programming
  environments online designed for beginners that simplify the developer
  experience and allow you to focus on learning the basics without getting
  distracted by advanced features. Many of these come with built-in graphics
  libraries or support for game development. These include
  [code.org](https://code.org/) (develop and play games with JS),
  [editor.p5js.org](https://editor.p5js.org/) (create interactive artwork),
  [PencilCode](https://pencilcode.net/edit/myprogram) (write your code as blocks
  or text).

### 5. Beyond the Browser

You can also use JavaScript outside of the browser to create web servers,
develop mobile apps, program a
[Raspberry Pi](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_raspberrypi.asp), program
IOT (Internet of Things) Devices, and much more.

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is the most popular non-browser runtime for
JavaScript. [Deno](https://deno.land/) is a newer runtime developed as a more
secure and developer-friendly alternative to Node.js.
