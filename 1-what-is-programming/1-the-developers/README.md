# Developers

Developers are the ones designing the software, writing the code, and fixing the
bugs. As a developer you'll spend lots of time reading source code. So it's very
important to make sure your code is easy to understand.

You should think first of other developers who will need to understand your
program, and second of yourself. Why is this more productive? First because
working on a team is easier when everyone is looking out for each other. Second
because one day you'll be someone else! After even half an hour your thoughts
about a program are no longer fresh, you'll need to rely on what you wrote to
figure out the details of your own program.

- **For Developers**
  - **Static**: Comments, variable names and code formatting help developers
    read and understand source code.
  - **Dynamic**: Logs and error messages help developers understand what is
    happening inside the computer as it follows the code's instructions.
