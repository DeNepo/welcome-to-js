> **Just Enough JavaScript**

<details>
<summary>Priorities: 🥚, 🐣, 🐥, 🐔 (click to learn more)</summary>
<br>

There is a lot to learn in this repository. If you can't master all the material
at once, that's expected! Anything you don't master now will always be waiting
for you to review when you need it. These 4 emoji's will help you prioritize
your study time and to measure your progress:

- 🥚: Understanding this material is required, it covers the base skills you'll
  need for this module and the next. You do not need to finish all of them but
  should feel comfortable that you could do them with enough time.
- 🐣: You have started all of these exercises and feel you could complete them
  all if you just had more time. It may not be easy for you but with effort you
  can make it through.
- 🐥: You have studied the examples and started some exercises if you had time.
  You should have a big-picture understanding of these concepts/skills, but may
  not be confident completing the exercises.
- 🐔: These concepts or skills are not necessary but are related to this module.
  If you are finished with 🥚, 🐣 and 🐥 you can use the 🐔 exercises to push
  yourself without getting distracted from the module's main objectives.

### [1. What is Programming](./1-what-is-programming)

What is a program? What is a programming language? How do programs and people
fit together?

- [ ] 🥚 **Data in, Data Out**: You understand that computer programs are used
      to transform data, and can explain a JS program from this module in terms
      of the data that goes in and the data that comes out.
- 🥚 **Three Audiences**: You can explain how a single file of code is used to
  communicate with 3 different audiences:
  - [ ] **Developers**: You can explain how code formatting, comments, logs and
        variable names make it easier (or harder!) for a developer to understand
        a program.
  - [ ] **Computers**: You can explain how a computer follows your instructions
        to store, read and modify data in program memory.
  - [ ] **Users**: You can explain how the computer creates a dynamic user
        experience by following different executions paths depending on user
        input.
- [ ] 🥚 **Tracing Variables**: You can complete a trace table for a program
      that uses only variables, and can check your work using the "trace"
      button.

### [2. Just Enough JavaScript](./2-just-enough-javascript)

Go in depth on JavaScript you need to know for writing interactive text-based
programs in the browser. Along the way you will learn how each language feature
works in small programs.

- 🥚 **JavaScript Syntax**: Given a program, you can identify these parts of
  JavaScript syntax:
  - [ ] _Primitives_
  - [ ] _Operators_
  - [ ] _Identifiers_
  - [ ] _Keywords_
  - [ ] _Checks_
  - [ ] _Blocks_
  - [ ] _Function Calls_
- 🥚 **Listening and Reading**: You can read code out loud, and understand your
  classmates when they read code to you. You don't need to understand how a
  program works to master these learning objectives!
  - [ ] **Listening** You can exactly re-write a program that a classmate has
        read
  - [ ] **Reading** You can read a program out loud and guide your classmates to
        re-write _exactly_ the same code without them seeing the program. Every
        indentation, semi-colon, comment and spelling in their program must be
        identical to yours.
- 🥚 **Static vs. Dynamic Analysis**: You can explain and use these two ways of
  studying a program, each can help you understand different aspects of your
  code. To help understand this concept, the _options_ panel in Study Lenses is
  organized into _static_ and _dynamic_ study options:
  - [ ] **Static**: Studying the text in a code file _without_ running it. Some
        static study methods are creating a flowchart, analyzing variables,
        filling out a trace table, and drawing on code.
  - [ ] **Dynamic**: _Running_ code and studying the computer's behavior. Some
        dynamic study methods are running code and reading console logs, using
        the _trace_ button, and stepping through in the debugger or JS Tutor.
- [ ] 🥚 **Tracing Execution**: You can complete a "steps" trace table for all
      JS language features in Just Enough JavaScript, and can correct your table
      using console output from the "trace" button.
- [ ] 🥚 **Analyzing Variables**: You can list all the variables in a program,
      and answer these 5 questions for each variable:
  - _Where is the variable declared?_
  - _What is the variable's scope?_
  - _Is the variable initialized with a value?_
  - _How many times is its value used \(read\) in the program?_
  - _How many times is the variable assigned a new value?_
  - _What types are assigned to this variable during the program's execution?_
- [ ] 🥚 **Completing Programs**: You can successfully fill in blanks for a
      program when the missing words are provided, including distractors.
- [ ] 🐣 **Translating Pseudo Code**: Given a program written in Pseudo Code,
      you can translate it to working JavaScript.
- [ ] 🐣 **Comparing Programs**: You can compare two programs with similar code
      and explain if they have the same behavior or not. If they do not, you can
      explain how they behave differently and why.
- [ ] 🐥 **Constructing Programs**: You can reconstruct a program's lines and
      indentation, successfully ignoring distractor lines.

### [3. Understanding Programs](./3-understanding-programs)

Learn how to understand a larger programs by finding connections between the
details and the big picture. By the end of this chapter you will know how to
read a new program and do a simple code review.

- [ ] 🥚 **Stepping Through**: You can pause a script in a your browser's
      debugger, arrange the debugger, collapse extra panels, and step through a
      script written with Just Enough JS. At each point in execution you can
      make a prediction of the next line before executing, and can check your
      prediction using the _scopes_ panel.
- [ ] 🥚 **Imperative Programming**: You can explain what the Imperative
      Programming paradigm is, and can explain how you know the programs in
      Welcome to JS are Imperative.
- [ ] 🥚 **Program Goals**: You understand that a full JavaScript program can be
      explained as a series of smaller goals, and can write names for the goals
      in a simple working program.
- [ ] 🥚 **Logging**: You can tracing specific aspects of a program's execution
      and log them to the console.
- [ ] 🐣 **Tracing Backwards** You can trace backwards from a program's output
      to it's input.
- [ ] 🐣 **Naming Variables**: You can analyze how a variable is used in a
      program and give it two names:
  - **Generic**: You can give a generic name to a variable based on how it is
    used in the program.
  - **Specific**: You can give a specific name to a variable based on how it's
    used _and_ the program's domain (the program's specific data and use-case).
- [ ] 🐣 **Describing Programs**: You can read a program and describe it with
      comments using to the methodology from `/describing-programs`:
  1. Zoom Out
  2. Zoom In
  3. Find Connections
  4. Describe Goals
- [ ] 🐣 **Code Review**: Given a working program you can review the code for
      clarity, correctness and style.

### [4. Developing Programs](./4-developing-programs)

Learn to modify and write larger programs in JavaScript. You'll cover many of
the hidden skills necessary to develop quality software and to work
collaboratively on a code base.

- [ ] 🥚 **Linting**: You can find and fix simple linting errors in JavaScript
      programs.
- [ ] 🥚 **Program Life Cycle**: You can explain the two phases of a program's
      life cycle.
  1. _Creation Phase_
  2. _Execution Phase_
- [ ] 🥚 **Fixing Errors**: You can use the structured comment to describe an
      error in your program, and can make several educated guesses at how to fix
      the error.
- [ ] 🐣 **Fixing Bugs**: You can use the structured comment to describe and fix
      a bug in small programs.
- [ ] 🐣 **Modifying Programs**: You can make small changes in a program to
      change its behavior without breaking it.
- [ ] 🐥 **Refactoring**: Given a working program, you can make changes to the
      code without changing the program's user-facing behavior.
- [ ] 🐥 **Legacy Code**: You can understand and rewrite a poorly written
      program to improve the experience of all 3 audiences: _developer_, _user_,
      _computer_.
- [ ] 🐥 **Writing Programs**: Given a description of a program's behavior
      (_user story + test cases_), you can plan goals for the program and write
      code to pass the tests.
- 🐔 **Reverse Engineering**: Given a working program with unreadable code, you
  can:
  - [ ] Give the program a name.
  - [ ] Describe the program's behavior with a user story, acceptance criteria
        and test cases.
  - [ ] Plan goals for the program.
  - [ ] Develop your own working program with the exact same behvior.
- 🐔 **Imagining Programs**: Given an empty page, you can imagine and develop
  your own programs using Just Enough JavaScript. This includes:
  - [ ] A title.

## Code Quality Scripts

This repository comes with some scripts to check the quality of this code. You
can run these scripts to check the code provided by HYF, and to check the code
you write when experiment with the examples and complete the exercises.

### `npm run format`

This script will format all of the code in this repository making sure that all
the indentations are correct, the code is easy to read, and letting you know if
there are any syntax errors.

### `npm run spell-check`

This script will check all of the files in your repository for spelling
mistakes. Spelling is not just a detail, is important! Good spelling helps
others read and understand your programs with less effort.

`spell-check` is not so clever though, it doesn't have _all_ possible words in
it's dictionary and it won't know if you _wanted_ to spell a word incorrectly.
If you think one of it's "Unknown word"s is not a problem, you can either ignore
the suggestion or add the word to the `"words": [ ... ],` list in
[.cspell.json](./.cspell.json).

### `npm run lint:md`

This script will [lint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_%28software%29) all
the Markdown files in this repository, checking for syntax mistakes and other
bad practices. Fixing linting errors will help you learn to write better code by
pointing out your mistakes _before_ they cause problems in your program.

Some linting errors will take some practice to understand and fix, but it will
be a good use of time.

### `npm run lint:js -- ./path/to/code`

Just like `lint:md`, but for `.js` files. This script will lint all of the JS
files in this repository, letting you know if there are any syntax errors or bad
practices.
