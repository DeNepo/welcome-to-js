# Errors

Errors are unavoidable in programming. In Welcome to JS most of the exercises ask you to study working programs so you shouldn't face tooo many errors. When you do get an error, don't let this get you down. It's easier to write code that _has_ errors than to write code that _doesn't_!

Understanding and fixing errors in your code will take lots of practice, in the Debugging module you will study errors in depth. For now all you need to know about errors is:

- the error _name_ and _message_ so you can search about it online
- finding the line where the error occurred by reading the console output
- `ctr-z`, so you can undo your error

As you complete each exercise you should keep track of all the errors you encountered. Try thinking of errors as the computer's best attempt at helping you fix your mistakes. Take notes on which errors you make the most often and what you figure out to avoid them.

## ReferenceError: \_ is not defined

There is one error you do not need to keep track of in your notes - `ReferenceError: _ is not defined`. You will get this error all the time, and it's not because of the code you write. we use \_ to show you where something is missing in the program, but JavaScript reads \_ as a variable that has not been declared.

Instead of dreading this error, you can thank it for telling you where the next blank is!
